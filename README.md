# Why is this modpack here?

My friends and I love playing Minecraft. So one day I said to myself that we could create a server again and play. But since I just got a Raspberry Pi (a computer that fits in your hand but can handle 10 fabric modifications 1.20.1 server and website at the same time) so we won't pay for hosting, or Aternos, and it won't run on my PC that has Minecraft as a PowerPoint presentation and that we'll try it out and that the server might later be open to the public...
